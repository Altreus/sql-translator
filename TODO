*   Some way to deeply check to schema objects, e.g., for testing I
    parse a MySQL schema, translate to Oracle, then parse the created
    Oracle schema and want to check the two schema objects.

*   Explore some way to pass an open database handle instead of a
    schema and then query through DBI methods to get the schema
    definition, somewhat a la SQL::Schema (which only works with
    Oracle right now)

*   Add "CREATE VIEW" support to existing parsers

*   At least allow more pass-through of INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE
    statements

*   Add INSERT statements for xSV, Excel parsers to automatically
    create INSERTs for each row of data in the source file

*   Fix Sybase parser (which means really figuring out the dump format
    we want to parse -- Sam, can you recommend something?)

*   Add more parsers (though I need some ideas -- probably at least
    one for SQLite since we have that producer)

*   Somehow merge ClassDBI producer with CGI::FormBuilder or Template
    Toolkit and some sort of automated CGI builder to create
    view/create/edit/delete forms for objects based on schema defs

*   Embetter the Diagram producer to use some real graphing algorithms
    to distribute the tables so that the lines don't overlap so badly

*   Integrate more with some standard XML schema representations,
    maybe like Torque DB (http://db.apache.org/torque/), add parsers
    and producers

*   Possibly write a basic ANSI-92 SQL parser which could be extended
    when writing other new parsers -- can anyone help me nail down a
    URL that describes in detail that spec?

*   Expand sql_translator.cgi to be a frontend for all producer
    formats, not just the graphical ones;  also improve the interface
