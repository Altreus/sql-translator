	* t/08postgres-to-mysql.t: Changed to use Test::More, cleaned up
	syntax.  Still pretty useless.

2003-05-03 10:40  kycl4rk

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/PostgreSQL.pm: "size" of a field needs
	to be an arrayref as it could be two numbers (e.g., for a float
	"10,2").

2003-05-03 10:21  kycl4rk

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Producer/XML.pm: Fixed error 'Use of

	new stuff to mirror development of the Schema::* classes.

2003-05-02 23:09  kycl4rk

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/PostgreSQL.pm: Using some of the rules
	from the PG grammar to make mine better, cleaned up the handling of
	datatypes (esp WRT auto-inc), only placing PK defs as table
	constraints (not an index), getting ready to parse views.

2003-05-02 23:07  kycl4rk

	* t/: 02mysql-parser.t, 13schema.t: Adding new schema test,
	commiting fixes to MySQL parser test.

2003-04-30 16:58  kycl4rk

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/MySQL.pm: Fixed error that was
	preventing MySQL parser from working with Parse::RecDescent 1.94
	(needed a "1;" at the end of the create rule); also made changes to
	%item hash elements with repeat modifiers to match what they're now
	called in Parse::RecDescent 1.94;  these changes now make the
	parser incompatible with earlier versions of P::RD!

	Made SQLite producer produce actual auto incremented fields (using
	the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY hack) if the field is an auto-incremented
	one.  This modifies slightly how indexes are produced.
	
	Also modified how mk_name is called in the SQLite producer; SQLite
	doesn't accept index names that begin with numbers.

2003-04-06 09:29  mmelillo

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/Excel.pm: Init Check in. This follows
	closely along the lines of xSV.pm but its cooler because I used

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/PostgreSQL.pm: i forget what i did, but
	i found more bugs.  we need to be able to support 'varchar' as
	implying 'varchar(255)' for both field and index declarations. 
	also 'double precision' as a synonym for 'double'.  also, mysql
	doesn't support boolean datatype, but postgres does, so we need to
	find a way to deal with this.
	
	that's all for now.

	t/07p_args.t: 
	Added new files to MANIFEST.
	
	Started updating tests to use Test::More, rather than the homegrown
	print stuff I'd started with (bad darren!).
	
	The load test uses SQL::Translator::load, to both exercise load()
	and to perform the actual test (I've intentionally used load
	instead of Test::More::use_ok).
	
	Added more dependencies to Makefile.PL.
	
	Sorted the dependencies in PREREQ_PM, and the file list in
	MANIFEST, because I'm obsessive about those sorts of silly things.

2003-02-21 02:42  allenday

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Parser/PostGreSQL.pm: an adaptor for postgres.
	 this works, but i think my primary key and foreign key parses are
	hackish.  they require the pk/fk clause _right_after_ the field
	declaration, which i don't think is how postgres requires it.
	
	also i've found a bug in the mysql parser that is in the postgres
	parser as well that doesn't allow comments in the middle of table
	create statements.  this will cause a failed parse:
	
	create table x (   x int, -- a comment );

	and data methods to Translator.pm.  Silly change to Makefile.PL

2002-03-21 09:52  dlc

	* t/data/mysql/BGEP-RE-create.sql: Removed comment lines (the
	parser chokes on these, I think).  Changed DEFAULT x NOT NULL lines
	to NOT NULL DEFAULT x, so overcompensate for a bug in the MySQL
	parser.  Removed references to FULLTEXT indexes, because the MySQL
	grammar doesn't know about them.

2002-03-21 09:50  dlc

	* t/04file,fh,string.t: Removed warns and debugging, so this test
	will actually pass when run as part of make test.

2002-03-21 09:49  dlc

	Added myself to the AUTHORS section.

	* Changes: file Changes was initially added on branch darren-1_0.

2002-03-18 14:35  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Updated docs, especially detailed internal
	API docs.  Updated default sub to return the data structure (and
	not the SQL::Translator instance). This became an issue once the
	subs were redefined to accept two args.  Removed the possibility to
	pass a filehandle (or something that can getlines) as an option to
	translate.  Added many levels of code folding markers.	Updated
	parser to use a named class::function style of defining a function
	to call, just like producer.

2002-03-18 14:32  dlc

	* t/04file,fh,string.t: Changed many assumptions about the test. 
	Uses the default parser and producer (which is a pass through)

2002-03-18 14:30  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator/Producer/Oracle.pm: Added note of a bug

	* lib/SQL/: Translator.pm, Translator/Parser.pm,
	Translator/Producer.pm, Translator/Parser/MySQL.pm,
	Translator/Producer/Oracle.pm: Added copyright notices to top of
	files.	Updated documentation to be accurate.  Updated parser and
	producer classes to work with the modified API defined by
	SQL::Translate.  SQL::Translator instances have data members named
	parser_type and producer_type that can be used to determine from
	whence the parser and producer subroutines come.  SQL::Translator
	will accept parsers and producers in the form
	Class::Name::function, just like mod_perl, in addition to
	Class::Name (with the implicit function name), Name (relative to
	SQL::Translator::{Parser,Producer}, and anonymous subroutines.

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Many, many changes.  Changed the basic
	assumptions about the module.  Parser and Producer packages no
	longer need to be object oriented, they merely need to implement a
	parse or translate function (respectively).
