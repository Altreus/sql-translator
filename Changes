	* Changes: file Changes was initially added on branch darren-1_0.

2002-03-18 15:35  dlc

	* lib/SQL/Translator.pm: Updated docs, especially detailed internal
	API docs.  Updated default sub to return the data structure (and
	not the SQL::Translator instance). This became an issue once the
	subs were redefined to accept two args.  Removed the possibility to
	pass a filehandle (or something that can getlines) as an option to
	translate.  Added many levels of code folding markers.	Updated
	parser to use a named class::function style of defining a function
	to call, just like producer.

2002-03-18 15:32  dlc

	* t/04file,fh,string.t: Changed many assumptions about the test. 
	Uses the default parser and producer (which is a pass through)

	* lib/SQL/: Translator.pm, Translator/Parser.pm,
	Translator/Producer.pm, Translator/Parser/MySQL.pm,
	Translator/Producer/Oracle.pm: Added copyright notices to top of
	files.	Updated documentation to be accurate.  Updated parser and
	producer classes to work with the modified API defined by
	SQL::Translate.  SQL::Translator instances have data members named
	parser_type and producer_type that can be used to determine from
	whence the parser and producer subroutines come.  SQL::Translator
	will accept parsers and producers in the form
	Class::Name::function, just like mod_perl, in addition to
	Class::Name (with the implicit function name), Name (relative to
	SQL::Translator::{Parser,Producer}, and anonymous subroutines.

	parse or translate function (respectively).
